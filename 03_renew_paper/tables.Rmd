The dependent variables are the vote shares of the Communist Party in the parliamentary elections between 2001 and 2010 at the community level (in percent). These results correspond to the results in Table 2. The propensity score summarizes the role of all non-migration community characteristics in explaining average Communist vote shares over the period 2001â€“2010. To construct it, we first run a regression of the Communist vote share averaged over the period 2001â€“2010 on all covariates used in our baseline specification (column 3 of Table 1) except the prevalence of emigration to the West and East. We then define the propensity score as the prediction from this regression. Standard errors, clustered at the district level, are in parentheses.")
